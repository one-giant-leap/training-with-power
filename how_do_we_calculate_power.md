# Metric Descriptions

To get the most out of training/racing with a power meter it is important that you understand how the device functions, and more importantly, what factors contribute to the data you observe on water or during post analysis.

###Cadence
Cadence is a measure of stroke rate, or the frequency at which the athlete is paddling. Cadence data is delivered in single strokes per minute.
Cadence is determined by measuring the time elapsed between the catch of each stroke. A low force threshold has been set so that the trigger for the stroke “start” is as representative of the blade entry as possible.
Cadence is one of the many variables that determine your level of performance and efficiency. The Kayak|Canoe|SUP Power Meter can help you find your optimum cadence – the cadence at which you can maintain the highest possible average power.
###Force (High Speed Data)
The force values are delivered in two data streams; pushing hand force and pulling hand force.
These values represent the force applied by the pushing hand (pushing during the stroke) and the pulling hand (pulling during the stroke). For example, during the stroke that occurs on the left side of the boat, the pushing hand force represents the right hand, and the pulling hand force represents left hand.
The force values are determined by strain gauges which are located on the shaft, and convert the amount of shaft bending they experience to hand-force values. Since the gauges measure shaft bending, hand position is an important factor. Hand positions must be uploaded correctly during the setup of the Kayak Power Meter. Hand positions have to be re-entered if the athlete decides to change their hand positions (e.g. opt for a wider grip), or the paddle length (e.g. extend the paddle by a few centimeters). Many athletes attach tape to the paddle shaft to create a physical marker which they can feel in order to keep their hands at the fixed position on the shaft. This is recommended.
