##Threshold Power

Threshold Power Output represents the exercise intensity at which lactate begins to accumulate in a person's blood - that is, their lactate threshold (LT).

##Z1
Zone 1 (Active Recovery = < 55% of Threshold Power)

##Z2
Zone 2 (Endurance = 56-75% of Threshold Power)

##Z3
Zone 3 (Tempo) = 76-90% of Threshold Power

##Z4
Zone 4 (Lactate Threshold) = 91-105% of Threshold Power

##Z5
Zone 5 (VO2 Max) = 106-120% of Threshold Power

##Z6
Zone 6 (Anaerobic Capacity) = 121-150% of Threshold Power

##Z7
Zone 7 (Neuromuscular Power) = Maximum Effort
