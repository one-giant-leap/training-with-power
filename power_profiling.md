# Power profiling

Power profiling is used to test an athlete's level of fitness over a range of long and short duration efforts. This gives the coach and athlete a total picture on all aspects of fitness.

The power profile is made up of a series of benchmark tests. A typical power profile is listed below. Coaches may refine the benchmark list depending on the demands of their targeted event.
