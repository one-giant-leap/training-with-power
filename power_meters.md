# Power Meters

Training with power overcomes the weaknesses of the other performance measurement devices. Power meters measure the power-output, force and stroke-rate of a paddler, and they are the only device which will provide you with a direct measurement of the exact thing that governs performance - energy output. Because power is unaffected by external factors such as environmental conditions, you are able to track and compare your performances knowing that the data you're viewing is due to effort alone. This gives you incredibly powerful information which (among other benefits) will allow you to find your optimal stroke-rate, develop your most efficient technique, set training levels and track your fitness development.
