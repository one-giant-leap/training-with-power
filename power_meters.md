# Power meters

Training with _power_ overcomes the weaknesses of the other performance measurement devices. Power meters measure the power-output, force and stroke-rate of a paddler. Power meters are the only devices which provide you with a direct measurement of your energy output. Energy output is the exact thing that governs performance.

With a power meter you are able to track and compare your performances knowing that the data you're viewing is due to effort alone. This is because _power_ is unaffected by external factors such as environmental conditions. This gives you incredibly powerful information which will allow you to find your optimal stroke-rate; develop your most efficient technique; set training levels and track your fitness development.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- |
| Measurement of pulling hand force, pushing hand force, power and stroke-rate (cadence) in a single device | A power meter comes as a shaft (with a stiffness of your choosing) to which you attach your own set of blades i.e. it can't be applied to your existing shaft |
| The only monitoring device that can analyze an individual stroke in-depth with high speed data (sampling at 60 times a second). This allows for technique analysis, left/right stroke profile comparisons, team boat athlete comparisons, and identification of weaknesses or imbalances in stroke | A power meter shaft can be used with different sets of blades, however it requires the process of removing/attaching blades with hot glue which takes some time and effort |
| Enables you to develop a more efficient technique - one that allows you to maintain your target/race speed whilst minimizing power output ||
| Helps you find your optimal stroke-rate - the cadence which allows you to sustain the highest average power output over a specific distance or time ||
| You can track your fitness levels, free from the effects of lag-time and environmental conditions ||
| Allows you to control and monitor training intensities by measuring real-time intensity, without lag ||
| Power meters are not affected by changes in equipment e.g. you do not need to re-test power targets if you switch your blades ||
| Provides precise stroke-by-stroke timing analysis - useful for synchronization in team boats ||
