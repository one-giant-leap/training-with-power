# GPS Speed and Distance Monitor
Speed and Distance Monitors are a useful addition to any paddler's training regime. They are helpful in determining pacing and race planning in particular, and the fact that GPS speed data integrates with many tracking apps means it is a great way to log your training history. Keeping a record of training is important for making sure you are meeting your training requirements.

The caveat of a GPS Speed and Distance Monitor is that while the information it provides can be very useful, there is the fact that speed is easily affected by environmental conditions (such as wind and water current). This means that it can be difficult to separate out your actual effort from the external factors affecting your boat.
