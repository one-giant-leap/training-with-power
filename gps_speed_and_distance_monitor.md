# GPS Speed and Distance Monitor
Speed and Distance Monitors are a useful addition to any paddler's training regime. They are helpful in determining pacing and race planning in particular, and the fact that GPS speed data integrates with many tracking apps means it is a great way to log your training history. Keeping a record of training is important for making sure you are meeting your training requirements.

The caveat of a GPS Speed and Distance Monitor is that while the information it provides can be very useful, there is the fact that speed is easily affected by environmental conditions (such as wind and water current). This means that it can be difficult to separate out your actual effort from the external factors affecting your boat.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- |
| Speed/distance and time information can be displayed in a variety of convenient formats to match your particular paddlesport discipline e.g. time/1000m (sprint kayakers) | The effect of environmental conditions on speed can be significant e.g. wind, water current. This makes it difficult to understand whether increased/decreased speed is due to your performance, or from external factors affecting your boat |
| Keeping track of pace/speed is useful for maintaining training quality or when pacing during a race ||
| Simple post analysis - a wide variety of apps available which take recorded speed data and process it quickly into a format for easy analysis ||
| Great for tracking training volumes (distance traveled and duration) ||
| *Can* be used as a gauge of intensity - training intensities can be set by pace, but only if environmental conditions are managed (which is difficult to achieve) ||
| Effective way of fitness tracking e.g. tracking 5 km time trial times over the course of a season will give an sign of how your fitness is developing - again though, environmental conditions need to be kept in check when doing these 'benchmark tests' ||
