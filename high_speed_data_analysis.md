# High Speed Data Analysis

High Speed Data is the recording of pushing hand force (N), pulling hand force (N) and power (W) at 50 times a second (a sample every 20 milliseconds).

The high frequency at which the data is sampled allows for individual strokes to be analyzed; left and right imbalances to be identified; and stroke-timing in team-boats to be investigated.

In a sports science laboratory environment, High Speed Data would be the tool of choice for a biomechanist, whereas a physiologist would be predominately interested in Real-time Data.
