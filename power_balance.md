# Power Balance

Power Balance represents how the athlete's total power output is distributed between their left and right stroke. Power Balance is determined by calculating the power generated during the left and right stroke separately, and representing each as a percentage of the total.

The left stroke is the stroke that occurs when the paddle enters the water on the left hand side of the boat. The right stroke occurs on the right side of the boat. A power balance of 55%-45% indicates that the left stroke is generating more power than the right stroke, and that the left stroke power accounts for 55% of the total power generated.

Power Balance is handy for identifying technique imbalances, weaknesses, and paddle offset angle effects.
