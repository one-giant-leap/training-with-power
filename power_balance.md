# Power Balance

Power Balance represents how the athlete's total power output is distributed between their left and right stroke. Power Balance is determined by calculating the power generated during the left and right stroke separately, and representing each as a percentage of the total.

The left stroke is defined as starting when the paddle exits the water on the right hand side and ends when the paddle exits the water on the left hand side.

The right stroke is defined as starting when the paddle exits the water on the left hand side and ends when the paddle exits the water on the right hand side.

A power balance of 55%-45% indicates that the left stroke is generating more power than the right stroke. It also indicates that the left stroke power accounts for 55% of the total power generated.

Power Balance is handy for identifying technique imbalances, weaknesses, and paddle offset angle effects.
