# High Speed Data Analysis (Single Athlete)

A power meter can typically record Power and Force at 50Hz or more (times per second) allowing for in-depth analysis of technique and performance. High Speed Data is the name given to this data. Unlike the once-per-second data displayed in real-time and recorded on an ANT+ display, High Speed Data is recorded and stored on-board the Kayak Power Meter for post analysis.

The High Speed Data allows force and power curves to be generated for all strokes over the recording duration. Below is an example section of High Speed Data.
