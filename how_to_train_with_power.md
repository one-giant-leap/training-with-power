# How to Train with Power


## Control Training Intensities
As we discovered in the previous section, a power meter is the only device to take a direct measurement of intensity (rate of energy output). Heart Rate and GPS Speed provide an indirect indication of intensity and have a number of limitations, whilst using stroke rate as an indication of intensity is inherently flawed.

A power meter delivers real time intensity measurement, without lag. Power values are not influenced by environmental conditions, meaning intensity values can be compared from day-to-day. For this reason, a power meter is the best tool for controlling and monitoring training intensities.

##Finding Threshold Power
The concept of threshold power forms the basis for training with power, as all training zones are set relative to threshold power.


> What is Threshold Power?
> 
> Threshold Power Output represents the exercise intensity at which lactate begins to accumulate in a person's blood - that is, their lactate threshold (LT). 
The metabolic strain experienced when paddling is dependent upon the athletes intensity relative to their lactate threshold intensity. For this reason, an athlete's Threshold Power Output provides a sound reference point around which a training program and training zones can be structured.
