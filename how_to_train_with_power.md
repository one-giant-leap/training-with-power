# How to Train with Power


## Control Training Intensities
As we discovered in the previous section, a power meter is the only device to take a direct measurement of intensity (rate of energy output). Heart Rate and GPS Speed provide an indirect indication of intensity and have a number of limitations, whilst using stroke rate as an indication of intensity is inherently flawed.

A power meter delivers real time intensity measurement, without lag. Power values are not influenced by environmental conditions, meaning intensity values can be compared from day-to-day. For this reason, a power meter is the best tool for controlling and monitoring training intensities.
