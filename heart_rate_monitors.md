# Heart Rate Monitors

Heart rate monitors have been in use for many decades. They were really one of the first devices that the everyday athlete could use to measure their performance. Measuring heart rate is still popular today and because they have been in use for so long, there are numerous scientific studies available which relate heart rate to intensity and training zone setting. This device certainly has its place in a well balanced training regime.

Heart rate monitoring is an effective method of gauging training intensities. It does however have a number of limitations which require careful management. A key point is that a heart rate monitor doesn't give you a direct measurement of intensity. Instead, a heart rate monitor measures your body's response to intensity. _This is a key distinction to make._

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- |
| Plentiful information explaining how to use heart rate to create an effective training schedule (for endurance athletes in particular) | Provides inconsistent data - heart rate is affected by many factors other than your body's training effort e.g. lack of sleep, caffeine, stress, temperature, adrenalin |
| Can assist with setting training levels and ensuring you're not over-training | Heart rate decreases as you get fitter so you constantly need to reset training levels |
| Good stepping stone to performance feedback (using data to support your training) | Ineffective measurement of intensity due to lag time e.g. you sprint but your heart rate doesn't register the increased effort until 30 seconds later |
