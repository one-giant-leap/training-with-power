# Heart Rate Monitors

Heart rate monitors have been in use for decades now, and they were really one of the first devices that the everyday athlete could use to measure their performance. They are still popular today and because they have been in use for so long, there are numerous scientific studies available which relate heart rate to intensity and training zone setting. This device certainly has its place in a well balanced training regime. 

Heart rate monitoring is a very effective method of gauging training intensities, however it does have a few limitations which require careful management. The main point to keep in mind is that a heart rate monitor doesn't give you a direct measurement of intensity - it measures your body's response to intensity. This is a key distinction to make.
