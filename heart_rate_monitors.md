# Heart Rate Monitors
Heart rate monitors have been in use for decades now, and they were really one of the first devices that the everyday athlete could use to measure their performance. They are still popular today and because they have been in use for so long, there are numerous scientific studies available which relate heart rate to intensity and training zone setting. This device certainly has its place in a well balanced training regime.

Heart rate monitoring is a very effective method of gauging training intensities, however it does have a few limitations which require careful management. The main point to keep in mind is that a heart rate monitor doesn't give you a direct measurement of intensity - it measures your body's response to intensity. This is a key distinction to make.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- |
| Plentiful information explaining how to use heart rate to create an effective training schedule (for endurance athletes in particular) | Provides inconsistent data - heart rate is affected by many factors other than your body's training effort e.g. lack of sleep, caffeine, stress, temperature, adrenalin |
| Can assist with setting training levels and ensuring you're not over-training | Heart rate decreases as you get fitter so you constantly need to reset training levels |
| Good stepping stone to performance feedback (using data to support your training) | Ineffective measurement of intensity due to lag time e.g. you sprint but your heart rate doesn't register the increased effort until 30 seconds later |
