# Understanding Common Terms
Using power data to help you paddle faster can sometimes seem like a daunting prospect, which is why we will be making everything as easy to understand as possible for you. This page will go over some of the more common metrics that will be mentioned throughout this guide.
### Power
A power meter measures the power applied to the paddle by the athlete. At its simplest, power is calculated by multiplying force x cadence. The power value represents the energy output rate of the paddler (Watts), and provides a direct measure of the athlete's intensity.
This direct measure of intensity is of vital importance for setting training levels, tracking fitness development, improving efficiency and race planning.
###Power Balance
Power Balance represents how the athlete's total power output is distributed between their left and right stroke. The power balance is determined by calculating the power generated during the left and right stroke separately, with each side represented as a percentage of the total. 
The left stroke is the stroke that occurs when the paddle enters the water on the left hand side of the boat. The right stroke occurs on the right side of the boat. A Power Balance of 55%-45% indicates that the left stroke is generating more power than the right stroke, and that the left stroke power accounts for 55% of the total power generated.
Power balance is handy for identifying technique imbalances, weaknesses and paddle offset angle effects. 
###Cadence
Cadence is a measure of stroke-rate, or the frequency at which the athlete is paddling. Cadence data is shown in single strokes per minute, and it is one of the many variables that determine your level of performance and efficiency. 
One Giant Leap Power Meters can help you find your optimum cadence - the cadence at which you can maintain the highest possible average power. 
###Force
The force values are shown in the form of pushing hand force and pulling hand force. 
These values represent the force applied by the pushing hand (pushing during the stroke) and the pulling hand (pulling during the stroke). For example, during the stroke that occurs on the left side of the boat, the pushing hand force represents the right hand, and the pulling hand force represents the left hand.
