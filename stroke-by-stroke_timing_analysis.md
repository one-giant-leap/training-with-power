# Stroke-by-stroke timing analysis

The "Stroke-by-stroke timing" graph shows specific timing metrics for each stroke over the selected section of the recording. Each stroke is represented so that random irregularities can be identified and the level of consistency gauged (unlike the Average Stroke Curves).

The example graph above shows the timing of a K2. Since timing is measured relative to the reference athlete (usually the front seat paddler), only a single athlete is represented on the graph.

Perfect timing is indicated by a plot that is located on the horizontal '0' line (Y-axis). If an athlete has a timing plot that is located in the region above the '0' line, then that athlete has a late stroke when compared to the reference athlete. Plots below the '0' line indicate an early stroke. The distance between a timing plot and the '0' line represents the magnitude of the timing difference.

The smoothness of each plot provides an indication of how consistent the timing of each team member is. Irregular data (or jagged data) indicates random timing and could be due to the athlete having problems with keeping a rhythm. A "smooth" timing line represents consistency and should it be located above the '0' line, then the athlete is consistently late.

An athlete's timing ability may be related to cadence. For this reason, cadence is also displayed on the timing graph. Team members may have difficulty keeping time at certain cadences. For example, an athlete may deviate further from perfect timing as cadence increases towards e.g. 120 strokes-per-minute at the end of the session. This information is useful for setting cadence limits for optimum boat performance.

There are several timing metrics that can be selected for analysis in this graph format:

* Catch timing
* Peak force
* Peak power
* Exit timing
