* Maximum of 12 efforts per week

Efforts of 30 minutes at Z3 (**low**)
* Maximum of 3 efforts per session
* Maximum 15 per week

Efforts of 20 minutes at Z3 (**high**)

Zone 2 training should be one of the most important parts of an endurance based training program. It is essential for performance improvements. There are numerous studies supporting this and it is evident in the fact that a large majority of elite (endurance sport) athletes allocate 60-80% of their training time to Zone 2 training. Zone 2 training is at an intensity that stimulates Type 1 muscle fibers and mitochondrial growth. Training this zone in large volumes will improve the function of fat utilization, in turn preserving glycogen utilization. In addition to fat utilization, Type 1 muscle fibers are responsible for lactate clearance (lactate being the by-product of glucose utilization).

The combined effect of improved fat utilization and lactate clearance is improved athletic performance.
