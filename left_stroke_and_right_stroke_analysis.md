# Left stroke and right stroke analysis

Imbalances in force and power can highlight differences in technique between the L and R strokes, weaknesses (when compared to the opposite stroke), and effects caused by improper paddle offset. Subtle imbalances are not so crucial for single's boat (K1) athletes. However, symmetry is important for compatibility in team boats, and for achieving smooth boat run.

Visual analysis (coachâ€™s eye or video) will not pick up this "signature" imbalance. The paddler may appear to have good catch timing and stroke symmetry, but power and force may not be applied evenly.
