# Cadence

Cadence is a measure of stroke rate, or the frequency at which the athlete is paddling. Cadence data is delivered in single strokes per minute.

Cadence is determined by measuring the time elapsed between the catch of each stroke. A low force threshold has been set so that the trigger for the stroke "start" is as representative of the blade entry as possible.

Cadence is one of the many variables that determine your level of performance and efficiency. A power meter can help you find your optimum cadence â€“ the cadence at which you can maintain the highest possible average power.
