# "Stroke time" analysis

"Stroke time" is the time duration of the impulse phase (in milliseconds) for each stroke. It measures the time the paddle is in the water and experiences force.

For kayak singles (K1), having a stroke time balance isn't crucial for the best performance. For team boat paddlers, having an even (or compatible) L and R stroke time is desirable.
