# Do you want to improve your performance on the water?

If you're reading this guide then we can assume you probably do. Each and every paddler strives to improve their performance in some way, whether it is to set a new personal best or to win an Olympic medal. 

The challenge is - how do you go about achieving this?

The science is simple: increase your energy output, and your boat can got faster. To increase your energy output you need to focus on improving your fitness and strength, and to make your boat go faster you need to convert that increased energy output into forward motion.

They key to achieving these objectives is being able to accurately measure and track your energy (power) output. A power meter will enable you to do this. Unlike heart rate monitors, which measure your body’s response to intensity, or GPS speed measuring devices, which are affected by environmental conditions, a power meter provides you with a direct measurement of the exact thing that governs performance - energy output. This direct measure of intensity is of vital importance for setting training levels, tracking fitness development, improving efficiency and race planning. 

This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about training with power, and how using the Kayak Power Meter as a training tool can help you achieve the results you want on the water.


## About One Giant Leap
One Giant Leap are the leading developers of paddling technology. We specialise in developing technology that provides real-time and post-analysis performance feedback for kayakers, canoeists and stand-up paddleboarders. 
It is our goal to enable paddlers to have the same level of performance technology that athletes such as cyclists have had available to them for years. We have done this by inventing the world’s first power meters for kayaking, canoe and stand-up paddleboarding (SUP), as well as developing a performance analysis app specifically for paddlers. 
We strive for to be the best at what we do, so that you can be the best at what you do.
I believe training with power and getting live feedback is an amazing tool to help develop a better technique and to train more efficiently. This type of information will help develop world champions.
