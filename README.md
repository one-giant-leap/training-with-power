# Do you want to train more effectively and paddle more efficiently?

If you're reading this guide then we can assume you probably do.

The challenge is - how do you go about achieving this?

The science is simple - the more power you output, the faster the boat *can* go. The challenge is to increase your fitness and strength to improve your power output and to convert as much of that energy into forward motion.

Achieving these objectives starts with being able to accurately measure and track your energy output. Unlike heart rate monitors, which measure the bodyâ€™s response to intensity, or GPS speed measuring devices and stroke rate sensors, which are affected by environmental conditions, a **power meter** provides you with a direct measurement of your energy output.

This guide will provide you with everything you need to know about training with power, and how using a power meter as a training tool can help you achieve the results you want on the water.
