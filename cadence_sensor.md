# Cadence/Stroke-Rate Sensor
In days gone by the only way to measure your cadence was to start a stopwatch and count the number of strokes performed over a given distance. Technology has since evolved to give us a more efficient means of measuring stroke-rate.

As with the previous two devices covered here, it is important to remember that cadence is just one part of the training picture. For example if your aim is to develop a more efficient stroke through use of a cadence sensor (by keeping stroke-rate steady but trying to increase speed), then you need to ensure that your speed is being accurately tracked as well. Likewise this device will be at its most useful if factors such as environmental conditions and equipment are managed.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
| -- | -- |
| Can be used to help the development of a powerful stroke – sessions where keeping cadence steady but trying to increase speed. Relies on accurate speed feedback to be implemented effectively | Stroke-rate is affected by environmental conditions e.g. wind, water current. These factors can increase or decrease stroke rate whilst the athlete maintains a consistent intensity (making it difficult to understand whether differences in stroke-rate performance are due to effort, or to external factors) |
| Targeting a particular cadence during training allows the athlete to adapt to the cadences experienced/required when racing (stroke-rate conditioning). Using a cadence sensor can let you know if you are meeting these targets | Cadence sensor data is influenced by equipment – e.g. switching to a larger blade will require more effort to sustain the same stroke-rate. In other words, you will need to re-evaluate your cadence targets when changing your equipment |
| Replaces the need for a coach with a stopwatch | Unlike a power meter, the data from a cadence sensor can't be used to compare individual and group (team-boat) sessions, because stroke-rate is not necessarily indicative of effort/intensity |
| *Can* be used to gauge paddling intensity, yet this relies on the paddler using consistent equipment and paddling in consistent conditions (difficult to achieve) ||
