# Power output analysis

### Overview Power Graph

The High Speed Data has been abbreviated into 1Hz (once a second) power data so that the intensity of each athlete can be compared over the duration of the recording.

[example graph coming soon]

A recording might test a 500m effort, for example. This graph will indicate what intensity each athlete is padding at and show features such as:

* Which athlete fatigues first
* Which athlete sets off too hard, or sets off too easy
* Which athlete holds the ideal intensity and executes the correct race plan

In the example graph above, it can be seen that Athlete #1 experiences fatigue and a gradual reduction in power output at the effort progresses. This could be due to high intensity output at the beginning of the effort. Athlete #2 has a more consistent power output, and is able to increase power near the end of the effort as the cadence rises. Understanding each athlete’s power development is critical when developing the ideal race plan.

Cadence is also shown on this graph so that any power/cadence relationship can be identified. A drop in an athlete’s power output may be due to an overly high or low cadence. This information is useful for setting cadence limits for optimum boat performance.

Note that the data show in this graph is the same as what would have been shown on a paired power compatible ANT+ display.
