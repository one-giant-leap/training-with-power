# Training to improve "30s/1min Power"

Suggested sessions to improve 30 second/1 minute power

Efforts of 20 seconds @ Z7
* 40 seconds rest between efforts
* 10 efforts per session

Efforts of 20 seconds – 30 seconds – 20 seconds (60s rest between) @ Z6

3 minutes rest between efforts
8 efforts per session
High intensity anaerobic training can not be sustained in high volume continuously. It can only be sustained in high volume for 6-8 consecutive weeks maximum. After this time, the effects of the sustained efforts risk athlete burn-out and illness. Understand the risk associated with these sessions. High intensity sessions, like those suggested in the 4min, 1min and 30s target sessions above, are best applied in the few months leading up to competition. They sharpen the athlete and develop race condition.
