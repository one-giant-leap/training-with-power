# Training to improve "30 second/1 minute Power"

**Suggested sessions to improve "30 second/1 minute Power":**

Efforts of 20 seconds @ Zone 7
* 40 seconds rest between efforts
* 10 efforts per session

Efforts of 20 seconds – 30 seconds – 20 seconds (60s rest between) @ Zone 6
* 3 minutes rest between efforts
* 8 efforts per session

High intensity anaerobic training can not be sustained in high volume continuously. It can only be sustained in high volume for 6-8 consecutive weeks maximum. After this time, the effects of the sustained efforts risk athlete burn-out and illness. Understand the risk associated with these sessions. High intensity sessions, like those suggested in the 4 minute, 1 minute and 30 second target sessions above, are best applied in the few months leading up to competition. They sharpen the athlete and develop race condition.
