# Identifying good and bad technique

The shape of the curves can be analyzed to evaluate technique. Sharp peaks in force do little to speed up the boat (short duration insufficient to counteract the mass-inertia of the boat and athlete), but these force peaks contribute to muscular fatigue.

By comparing an athlete's signature to a model technique, areas of weakness can be identified. For example, comparison might reveal an athlete is generating a comparatively low amount of power at the beginning of their stroke. The athlete would then focus on developing a more powerful catch. High Speed Data analysis allows the athlete to track the development of their signature as they implement technique changes.

When it comes to the 'ideal profile', it's generally agreed that the more square the profile, the better. Well, at least that is what the elite paddlers aim to achieve. By minimising force peaks and instead developing force evenly over the stroke, the stroke becomes more efficient and is less taxing on the paddler. These are some of the things to look for when analysing a profile:

 - A steep initial gradient. This represents immediate connection.

 - Even force profile during the mid section of the stroke. There may be a dip in the middle as you transition from catch to driving and pushing off the blade. This is common.

 - A sudden drop of power and force as the paddle exits.

From the many profiles I have seen, I can say that the profile image attached is typical of a good paddler. But before you go out and change the way you paddle to exactly mimic this image, you must know that there is noticeable variation in the profiles between athletes, even among the 'good' paddlers. The common factor relating these 'good' paddlers is the magnitude of their force and power. As long as you are trying to broaden your profile (think maximise the area under the curve) without applying a greater level of force, you're on your way to a more efficient stroke. I'm happy to take a look at some of your profiles and give an opinion if you'd like.
