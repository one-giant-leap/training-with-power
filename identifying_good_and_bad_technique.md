# Identifying good and bad technique

The shape of the curves can be analysed to evaluate technique. Sharp peaks in force do little to speed up the boat (short duration insufficient to counteract the mass-inertia of the boat and athlete), but these force peaks contribute to muscular fatigue.

By comparing an athleteâ€™s signature to a model technique (see below), areas of weakness can de identified. For example, comparison might reveal an athlete is generating a comparatively low amount of power at the beginning of their stroke. The athlete would then focus on developing a more powerful catch. High Speed Data analysis would allow the athlete to track the development of their signature as they implement technique changes.

High Speed Data analysis of long duration recordings can help identify technique changes due to fatigue. For example, an athlete may find that their left stroke signature changes significantly as fatigue sets in, developing some non-ideal characteristics. Once these effects are identified, specific training can be prescribed to minimise the effect. At the very least, learning of such tendencies will help the athlete focus on maintaining form during situations when the weakness can occur.
