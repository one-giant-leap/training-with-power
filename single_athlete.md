# High Speed Data analysis of a single athlete

A power meter can typically record Power and Force at 50 times a second or more allowing for in-depth analysis of technique and performance. High Speed Data is the name given to this data. Unlike the once-per-second data displayed in real-time and recorded on an ANT+ display, High Speed Data is recorded and stored on-board the Kayak Power Meter for post analysis.

The High Speed Data allows force and power curves to be generated for all strokes over the recording duration. Below is an example section of High Speed Data.

By selecting a focus section of the data, average force and power curves can be generated. This condenses all of the strokes contained in the focus area into a single representative stroke (based on the average of the selected strokes). Technique is represented by the force and power curves. Each athlete has their own characteristic curve, or "signature".
