# Tracking progress of "Threshold Power"

Threshold Power is a strong indicator of fitness. It is arguably the most important factor for determining performance in events ranging as short as 500m, to as long as a marathon race. The reason for this is that it is a representation of the athlete's Lactate Threshold expressed in Watts. Whilst endurance athletes are all to familiar with the concept of Lactate Threshold, sprint distance paddlers (e.g. 200m) will be less interested in this figure and can track more relative progress using power-profiling methods, which are explained in the next article.
